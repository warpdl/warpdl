## Gatekeeper Warning

If macOS blocks WarpDL:

```bash
# Remove quarantine attribute
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/warpdl
```

Or in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Allow anyway.

## Socket Permission Denied

If you see "permission denied" for the socket:

```bash
# Check socket permissions
ls -la /tmp/warpdl.sock

# Remove stale socket
rm /tmp/warpdl.sock
```

## Keychain Access

WarpDL uses the macOS Keychain for credential storage. If prompted, allow access.

To reset stored credentials:

```bash
security delete-generic-password -s "warpdl"
```

## Homebrew Issues

```bash
# Update tap
brew update
brew upgrade warpdl

# Reinstall if corrupted
brew reinstall warpdl
```

## M1/M2 (Apple Silicon)

WarpDL provides native ARM64 binaries. Ensure you download the correct architecture:

```bash
# Check architecture
file $(which warpdl)
```
