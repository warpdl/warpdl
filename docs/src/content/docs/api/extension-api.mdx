WarpDL extensions are JavaScript files executed using the Goja runtime.

## Extension Structure

```javascript
// extension.js
module.exports = {
    name: "my-extension",
    version: "1.0.0",

    onDownloadStart: function(download) {
        console.log("Download started: " + download.url);
    },

    onDownloadComplete: function(download) {
        console.log("Download complete: " + download.filename);
    }
};
```

## Available Hooks

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `onDownloadStart` | Called when download begins |
| `onDownloadComplete` | Called when download finishes |
| `onDownloadError` | Called on download failure |
| `onProgress` | Called periodically with progress |

## Download Object

```javascript
{
    url: "https://...",
    filename: "file.zip",
    size: 1024000,
    downloaded: 512000,
    speed: 1024,  // bytes/sec
    status: "downloading"
}
```

## Storage Location

## Limitations
