description: Understanding the WarpDL background daemon
---

WarpDL uses a daemon architecture where a background process manages all downloads.

## How It Works

```
CLI Command → Unix Socket/Named Pipe → Daemon → Download Engine
```

The daemon:
- Runs in the background
- Manages multiple concurrent downloads
- Persists state across CLI sessions
- Handles retry and resume logic

## Starting the Daemon

The daemon starts automatically when you run any download command. To start it manually:

```bash
warpdl daemon
```

## Stopping the Daemon

```bash
warpdl stop-daemon
```

## Communication

| Platform | Default IPC |
|----------|-------------|
| Linux/macOS | Unix socket at `$TMPDIR/warpdl.sock` (defaults to `/tmp/warpdl.sock`) |
| Windows | Named pipe `\\.\pipe\warpdl` |

To customize the socket path:

```bash
export WARPDL_SOCKET_PATH=/custom/path.sock
```

To force TCP connection:

```bash
export WARPDL_FORCE_TCP=1
export WARPDL_TCP_PORT=3849
```

## Daemon as a Service

See [Service Setup](/configuration/service-setup) for running the daemon as a system service.
