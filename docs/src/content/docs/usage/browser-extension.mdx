description: Integrating WarpDL with browser extensions via native messaging
---

WarpDL supports browser extension integration through the Native Messaging Host protocol. This allows browser extensions to communicate directly with the WarpDL daemon.

## Supported Browsers

| Browser | Protocol | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Chrome | Native Messaging | Supported |
| Firefox | Native Messaging | Supported |
| Chromium | Native Messaging | Supported |
| Edge | Native Messaging | Supported |
| Brave | Native Messaging | Supported |

## Installation

### Package Manager Install (Automatic)

If you installed WarpDL via Homebrew, Scoop, or a Linux package manager (deb/rpm), the native messaging host is configured automatically during installation.

### Manual Install

For manual installations, run:

```bash
warpdl native-host install --auto
```

This uses default extension IDs. For custom extension IDs:

```bash
warpdl native-host install \
  --chrome-extension-id "your-chrome-extension-id" \
  --firefox-extension-id "your-firefox-extension-id"
```

### Single Browser Install

```bash
warpdl native-host install --browser chrome --chrome-extension-id "extension-id"
warpdl native-host install --browser firefox --firefox-extension-id "extension-id"
```

## Check Status

```bash
warpdl native-host status
```

This shows installation status for all supported browsers.

## Uninstallation

```bash
warpdl native-host uninstall
```

Or for a specific browser:

```bash
warpdl native-host uninstall --browser chrome
```

## How It Works

```
Browser Extension → Native Messaging → warpdl native-host run → Daemon
```

1. Browser extension sends download requests via Native Messaging protocol
2. WarpDL's native host binary receives the message
3. Request is forwarded to the WarpDL daemon
4. Download proceeds with all WarpDL features (parallel segments, resume, etc.)

## Manifest Locations

The native messaging manifests are installed to browser-specific locations:

### Chrome/Chromium/Edge/Brave
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/google-chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/`
- **Windows**: Registry + `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\NativeMessagingHosts\`

### Firefox
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/NativeMessagingHosts/`
- **Linux**: `~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/`
- **Windows**: Registry + `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\NativeMessagingHosts\`

## Troubleshooting

### Extension can't communicate with WarpDL

1. Check if the daemon is running:
   ```bash
   warpdl list
   ```

2. Verify native host installation:
   ```bash
   warpdl native-host status
   ```

3. Reinstall native host:
   ```bash
   warpdl native-host uninstall
   warpdl native-host install --auto
   ```

### Permission Denied

Ensure the WarpDL binary has execute permissions:
```bash
chmod +x $(which warpdl)
```
