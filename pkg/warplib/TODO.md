# WARPLIB TODO

This document contains the list of things which might be added to the library in future.

1.) Merge parts if they're downloading `very fast` but only when `part size` is `large`. (Is this even possible huh?)

2.) Handle documents with unknown content length. (This is done ig)

3.) Fix downloads for different disk drives:
warp: rename C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming/warp/dldata/0dce3722/warp.dl D:\../100MB.bin: The system cannot move the file to a different disk drive.
