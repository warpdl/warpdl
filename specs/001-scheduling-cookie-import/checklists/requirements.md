# Specification Quality Checklist: Download Scheduling & Browser Cookie Import

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Two independent features (scheduling #140, cookie import #141) combined into a single spec per user request. They share no code or domain overlap — consider separate implementation tracks.
- Chrome encrypted cookies explicitly scoped out of P0 (documented in Assumptions).
- Speed limit scheduling (P3) depends on bandwidth throttling capability that may not exist yet.
- Queue manager integration (#135) deliberately excluded from scope.
